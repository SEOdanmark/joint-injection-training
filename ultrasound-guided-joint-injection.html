<p>In medicine, a joint shot (intra-articular injection) is a procedure utilized in the treatment of inflammatory joint problems, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, tendinitis, bursitis, Repetitive strain injury, and sometimes osteo arthritis. A hypodermic needle is infused right into the impacted joint where it provides a dosage of any kind of one of numerous anti-inflammatory agents, one of the most usual of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, as a result of its high viscosity, is sometimes utilized to change bursa fluids. The technique may be made use of to additionally take out excess liquid from the joint.</p>
