<p>In medication, a joint injection (intra-articular shot) is a treatment used in the treatment of inflammatory joint conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout pain, tendinitis, bursitis, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and periodically osteoarthritis. A hypodermic needle is infused right into the influenced joint where it delivers a dosage of any one of several anti-inflammatory agents, one of the most common of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, because of its high viscosity, is sometimes used to replace bursa fluids. The strategy may be made use of to additionally take out excess fluid from the joint.</p>
