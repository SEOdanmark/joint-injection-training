<p>In medication, a joint shot (intra-articular injection) is a treatment used in the treatment of inflammatory joint problems, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, Repetitive strain injury, and sometimes osteo arthritis. A hypodermic needle is infused right into the affected joint where it delivers a dosage of any among many anti-inflammatory representatives, the most common of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, because of its high thickness, is in some cases used to change bursa liquids. The method might be used to additionally withdraw excess liquid from the joint.</p>
