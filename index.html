<p>In medicine, a joint injection (intra-articular shot) is a procedure made use of in the therapy of inflammatory joint conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and sometimes osteoarthritis. A hypodermic needle is infused into the impacted joint where it delivers a dosage of any among numerous anti-inflammatory agents, the most common of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, as a result of its high thickness, is often made use of to replace bursa fluids. The method may be utilized to also withdraw excess fluid from the joint.</p>
