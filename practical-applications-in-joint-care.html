<p>In medicine, a joint injection (intra-articular injection) is a treatment used in the treatment of inflammatory joint conditions, such as rheumatoid joint inflammation, psoriatic arthritis, gout, tendinitis, bursitis, Repetitive strain injury, and periodically osteoarthritis. A hypodermic needle is injected into the affected joint where it provides a dosage of any type of one of many anti-inflammatory representatives, the most typical of which are corticosteroids. Hyaluronic acid, because of its high thickness, is in some cases used to change bursa liquids. The technique may be used to also withdraw excess liquid from the joint.</p>
